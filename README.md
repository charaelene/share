## Problem Statement
Currently, food waste remains as an issue. Food waste is detrimental, and it could occur in shared living or working environment like homes, work pantries, dormitories etc. 
In these pantries, there would be cooked or opened food items that are often forgotten which would lead to it being spoiled and discarded after. This way wastes not only food resources and money directly but environmental impact through increased landfill uses too. 

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, around 1.3 billion tonnes of food which is approximately 
one-third of all food produced globally are being wasted each year. In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) reported that 813,000 tonnes of food waste were generated in 2022, accounting for 12% of the total waste produced, with only 18% being recycled.

## Solution Justification
PantryBuddy addresses the issue of food waste in shared environments by providing users with a simple and effective way to log, track, and manage cooked or opened food items. 
Users can record food entries along with expected expiry dates and upload photos (optional). The app sends timely reminders before items are likely to expire, prompting users to consume or repurpose the food in time. 

Since this helps users track the productâ€™s expiry date and alerts the user, it reduces the likelihood of food being forgotten and discarded. This promotes mindful consumption and reduces any unnecessary waste, resulting in PantryBuddy contributing to environmental sustainability and supporting the Sustainable Living goals outlined in the Singapore Green Plan 2030.
